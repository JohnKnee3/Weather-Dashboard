//6.1.4 fetch() introduction and used dev tool to look at them under Network/repos/header/response.  Vid on Client Server Overview and JSON overview.
//6.1.5 .then to do something with what has been fetched and use .json to convert things into JSON so Javascript can use it.
//6.1.6 passed in a string from the call to the function to create something that can select any user that gets passed in.
//6.2.3 hardcoded the input form into the HTML using the provided CSS for styling
//6.2.4 addEventListener was used to call a new function that pulled the value of what was typed and send it to the next function.
//6.2.5 pretty dense stuff all surrounding creating elements from all of the parsed JSON data and grabbing the sepcific data you need from each step of the array using a for loop.
//6.2.6 if/else on the fetch to see if valid input.  .catch to show connection errors.
//6.3.3 Added a new HTML and JS for that page.  Shares the same CSS.
//6.3.4 Zero'd in on the issues page for this fetch and used ? in the URL to change the order of the info.
//6.3.5 Took the issues we received and created a list of links using <a> and href and _blank.
//6.3.6 checked Header from the fetch to see if it contained a "link" then made another <a> link in js
