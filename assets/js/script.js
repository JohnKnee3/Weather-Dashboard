//6.1.4 fetch() introduction and used dev tool to look at them under Network/repos/header/response.  Vid on Client Server Overview and JSON overview.
//6.1.5 .then to do something with what has been fetched and use .json to convert things into JSON so Javascript can use it.
//6.1.6 passed in a string from the call to the function to create something that can select any user that gets passed in.

//6.2.4 addEventListener was used to call a new function that pulled the value of what was typed and send it to the next function.
//6.2.5 pretty dense stuff all surrounding creating elements from all of the parsed JSON data and grabbing the sepcific data you need from each step of the array using a for loop.
//6.2.6 if/else on the fetch to see if valid input.  .catch to show connection errors.
